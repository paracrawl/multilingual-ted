It's activated when one recognizes cartoons, when one draws cartoons, and when one hallucinates them.
My mother sent yams and rice, and our old clothes, to his family.
And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid.
It's a circular thing.
And many of our ideas have been formed, not to meet the circumstances of this century, but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries.
Of course, where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do.
I'm a mule, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.
So you're not really sure what's going on with the pig.
If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve, but I wouldn't give you enough time.
The others just worked for the paycheck.
Even the BBC and The New York Times.
Then all this money started pouring in.
But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics.
How?
They want the washing machine in exactly the same way.
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.
A year.
Teaching and learning should bring joy.
I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants.
How did those students get all that knowledge?
Why do they market to us if we can't buy them?
Lying's complex.
In liquids, they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules.
So I think the basics are quite simple.
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.

This is a serious problem that we're losing our listening.
And look at the position of the old West.

What would it look like?
I wouldn't have qualified as transgender.
Many publishers were not quite so encouraging.
I write musicals; I make short films alongside my poems.
It has happened across the world.
And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first.
My self-confidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry, and it still always tastes funny in my mouth.
And it's the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual.
And if you trigger, if you stimulate with an electrode, the precise spot, you will trigger an orgasm.
And that's okay.
So people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment.
You're not sure you'd want to work for her.
Well, it's very simple.

Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone?
And they're going to answer these questions, whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses.
In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC, there was a manufacturing defect.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them somehow through more than 2,000 miles in China, and then into Southeast Asia.
It's not respectful, and it's not very clever to think that way.
The shores are from a different location.
And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability.
I have a suitcase full of books.
The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain.
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.

As we've changed beliefs about same-sex marriage, more people have been offered equal freedoms.
An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf.
But the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn't always work out that way.
Now, we've talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie.
(Laughter) (Applause)
In fact, I would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future.
Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.
(Dryer) It's a waltz.
And we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians.
Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well.
We need to group together.
Of course, in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight, but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian.
And what about the Sony Pictures cyberhacking?
So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.
And so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day, every kid works at their own pace — this is actually a live dashboard from the Los Altos school district — and they look at this dashboard.
But wherever you are, as I say, if you're in the travel industry, do that travel bit.
(Video) Man: Oh, my God.
She would catch the poem by its tail, and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page.
People have very different aptitudes.
And by the way, you don't need either; it's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it.

We take out the things that aren't plastics, such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber, wood, glass, paper, you name it.
I couldn't remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office I had a business card with my number.
And these frightened her.
It's a way of thinking about things.
It's what makes us different.
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too.
So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment, or even a specific trip.
And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.
I am told every day, by every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong.
Future's over here.
What we're doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R&D, or research and development.
You see it came down there.
Not rise to it, rise with it.
I know a woman who's good at this.
That's not our job.
In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community to build an algorithm that could grade high-school essays.
Now, I'm told that's not not just a squid phenomenon with males, but I don't know.
And even if the answer to the question is "no," it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been.
I have a confession to make.
He was in pursuit of the riches.
If you were actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed out.
Thank you all very much.
How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world?
Now not you, not this talk, but that is generally true.
So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking.
And I felt this sense of peacefulness.
We put suffocation warnings on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item in the United States.
And if you're doing the thing that you love to do, that you're good at, time takes a different course entirely.
I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.
But each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history.
Throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood, and she had hand washed laundry for seven children.
Now we move forward 380,000 years.
Well, what is going on with these people?
The question is, as a building professional, as an architect, an engineer, as a developer, if you know this is going on, as we go to the sights every single week, are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations?
With respect to marriage and family, there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could, and then you started having kids as soon as you could.
And then from about 500 years ago, humans began to link up globally through shipping, through trains, through telegraph, through the Internet, until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals.
My friend got to come.
School was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative, do wonderful things, make us earn a living, etc., etc.
Some know how they do it, whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP.
If they had, our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein.

It was a really very stressful time.
The first shock is recorded as very painful.

All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly-funded statistics.
I notice a couple of things about this.
That was a great day for my mother.

They are walking up and down stairs.
The more we click on this kind of gossip, the more numb we get to the human lives behind it, and the more numb we get, the more we click.
We're only just holding it together.
So now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today.
We have to throw it away.
Goes to F-sharp.
What you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it.
This is playing with those filters.
But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see — what's going on up in that little brain of hers.
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance.
Positively amazing.
Vision is one of the best things we do.
This is my supermarket.

(Laughter)
And it works the exact same way.
It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry.
He was charming and I was flattered, and I declined.
Now, what has happened?
But guess what happened?
We experience something that's valuable to us.
(Laughter) One girl named Mary said, "You asked my mother?"
If I said that there's somebody behind the screen who's very successful, certain ideas would immediately come to mind.
Well, it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have.
Can we stand to have more relationships?
Stories matter.
Art is about two things in all the major faiths.
So, this is the difference within Tanzania.
When you put them side-by-side, you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are.
Heavy!
Now the simple answer then is that genes alone don't, all by themselves, determine the outcome of very complicated things like language.
But he had a gift.
Very expensive real estate.
I'd like to kick off by looking at education.
So what do they stand for?
Clicks.
We want to see the change.
One of them is the idea of linearity: that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right, you will end up set for the rest of your life.
Because as we've heard all week at TED, the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff.
And I realized that perhaps the Western world will not continue to dominate the world forever.
In 2013, researchers at Oxford University did a study on the future of work.
So how can you live little?
People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source, for distant and unknowable reasons.
What happened?
And then after the First World War, they continue up.
We find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like, when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other Middle World objects move, and hits another Middle World object like a rock, it knocks itself out.
Everybody talks about happiness these days.
The lesson I want to leave you with, from these data, is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown, because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience.
That's just one source.
Just 10 minutes, undisturbed?
It's starts really, really early.
The general idea here, by the way, is that we actually don't know our preferences that well.
The next 13.5% of our population are our early adopters.
At the other end of the spectrum, you've got tragedy and tragic art.
Why do we struggle with it so much?
I don't know what it is.
(Laughter) And we were amazed that the local people, in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.
Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy.
Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0?

Our world is lit up 24 hours a day.
I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one.

And then I ask my students, I've asked them — over the last two years I've asked, "How many of you doesn't use a car?"
This country over here is China.
By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally as experiences.
With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all.
But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party, I don't have to say, "I'm a computer scientist."
But you know what?
I can go here and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries.
And I have pretty good news for you.
And you can't find this guy on Google; you can't find him anywhere.
And that's the story that we tell in big history.
He did not survive.
But nobody helped them, because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families.
This is real, tangible change, real, tangible change.
Thank you.
And we've all had the feeling, right?
And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light.
You were great.
This is preventable disease.
Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space.
But what I'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues, if we apply open-source collaboration.
They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.
Let's be frank and honest.
The long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder.
Let's see.
Maybe, just maybe, less might equal more.
He has to bury the people, OK?
Good to see you.
Brown.
Before they went through the social stress test, they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful.
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.
This should be the first principle of aid.
That'll teach him.
Sit them in a classroom, tell them about Plato at the age of 20, send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years, and that lesson will stick with them.
Now, recently, it has been found that it can change a lot.
But that's what we were told.
I couldn't disagree more.
And even that 95 percent student — what was the five percent they didn't know?
Perhaps the central purpose of the third act is to go back and to try, if appropriate, to change our relationship to the past.
The first one is Jim Wright.
Now in life, and in meditation, there'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense, and life starts to feel a bit like this.
Why not think about it this way?
So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.
So that's what we're going to do.
The consequences for some have become dire, very dire.
These kinds of things.
We've got a problem!
Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories that appeared on Google News' front page.
As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.
Because of that feeling, I was able to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction.
What do you do?
I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick.
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom.
Now, the going gets tougher.
What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits that we need to move away from.
I told you.
Local TV news looms large, and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.
And this.
My dream would never come true.
So, this is two minutes.
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art.
It's like, are science and plumbing compatible?

But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.
It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted.
And second, why it's such a problem.
It's therefore useful for our brains to construct notions like "solidity" and "impenetrability," because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle-sized world in which we have to navigate.
But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline.
It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something.
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq, find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction, liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.

I need you to understand it.
Can't even get them out the door, and I'm being serious.
As you can see, it's impossible to read.
This is not trivial.
As soon as the door closed... two out of three ate the marshmallow.
And I have brought for you a real human brain.
The journey by bus took one week, and we were almost caught several times.
And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I need to figure out what this is.
My mother carefully opened the door, and she loaded the laundry into the machine, like this.
So then I published the 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos and budgets on a wiki.
We investigate claims of the paranormal, pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults, and claims of all kinds between, science and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science, voodoo science, pathological science, bad science, non-science, and plain old non-sense.
There was this guy buying a book, he was in his 30s.
And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive.

What did they find?
I've not had a fight with my wife in two years.
If you're involved, say, in a travel industry in any way, look at pilgrimage.
But I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives.
So, how about "humanist"?
In other domains — the world of communications.
And I made these self-negating choices so reflexively, that I wasn't even aware that I was making them.
How big?
It then categorizes and organizes all that information, associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future all of our possibilities.
(Applause) From Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand.
(Laughter) So the best editing gives us a bit of both.
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages and the main one being English, or Chinese?
Being Australians, everybody has a beer.
Now, it had taken several days for this detail to come to light, and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us.
In the developing world, she said, they had two billion people.
So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly.
I also knew that I'm not alone.
So what happened in Colombia?
Here's what we find on testosterone.
Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence.
The rest of us, we're only 54 percent accurate.
Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain, our neocortex, corresponds with the "what" level.
You bring in, say, six objects, and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked.
The consequence of the single story is this: It robs people of dignity.
I want to say just a word about salad dressing.
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art.
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night, compared to neighbors.
But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do.
And this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see.
You look at their eyes.
And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point.
Whatever the expression, it was not very nice.
We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned.
There is a very personal price to public humiliation, and the growth of the Internet has jacked up that price.
I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world.
Now, here with 256 electrodes.
And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space.
It's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work.
If America does it, other people will follow.
All of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people.
Let me show you what I mean.
Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar.
And that, in fact, turns out to be true.
Her mum is a doctor, and her dad is a lawyer.
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap.
Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
So this is what the supermarket is like.
We will take it as a salutary warning, I think, for the rest of our conference this week.
And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S. and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships, big groupings, groupings that go back a long time, longer than the familiar families.
And this is the question: who am I being that my players' eyes are not shining?
But here, I want to say something nice about creationists.
(Laughter) I do not recommend this at all.
That guy made a mistake.
Education is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills, it's also going to make us better people.
So what we can conclude is you don't have to get rich to have few children.
We all have about 10% who just "get it."
(Applause)
We could change everything.
Come winter, three times as many people die.
What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really, truly changed their affective, hedonic, aesthetic reactions to that poster.
They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine, it'll change the course of the world.
But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other.
I'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making.
If I'm honest, this isn't why I went into it.
I guess we all deal with stress in different ways.
They show up when they want.
The third drops, the fourth, the fifth.
And it took about a year.
And when we run experiments, we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another.
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day?
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead.
In most cases, people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists.
And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself.
She is nine months old.
Socrates died in prison, his philosophy intact.
We were brought to teach English because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education.
How about a moderate amount of stress?
And therein lies a critical puzzle.
It's always difficult to predict, especially about the future.
And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life.
She said that, first of all, that she didn't know how to contact me.
Well, you can trip over 10% of the customers.
Would that give me a little more freedom?
My wife's just finished writing a novel, and I think it's a great book, but she disappears for hours on end.
And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect.
By using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32.
I thought that was the end of everything.
What you see here, the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas.
Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile.
And we're going to be able to invent brain-based interventions for children who have difficulty learning.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
And I often think that they have the best of all worlds.
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism.
(Music ends)
There's not even time or space.
Britlin was so innocent and so sweet, and her voice was so pure.
It starts playing immediately.
When they bombed Hiroshima, the explosion formed a mini-supernova, so every living animal, human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash.
It's soon going to be more than that.
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.
And finally, I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so, it is the single greatest moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.
This is a stronger knot.
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.
Now this, for me, is a common situation.
But let me give you a different perspective on the same story.
Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America.
So this message, that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
I started my journey in California, with a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook, and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life.
And there isn't much we can do about that.
And that, I think, is the hope.
Whatever you put in front of them, they'll take statistics on.
And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error, and can therefore be prevented by machines?
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things, like, for example, too much narcissism, right?
The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender.
I always wondered why they had lights, but we didn't.
Every single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease.
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning.
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.
It's the only asymmetrical expression.
It will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you're looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter, your mother or father.
In fact, we can even make the "stuff of life" — as I just said, all the stuff around us.
It's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading to realize whatever he's dreaming.
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle.
Everything in this world exists in Africa.
The good life is built with good relationships.
Now I'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what's in our way.
In 2006, young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps.
These countries have six children per woman.
In fact, mostly now in other things.
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
What was he thinking about?
(Laughter) I'm alive, you may have noticed.
The average lifespan's more than doubled since 1840, and it's increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day.
In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.
So, we've reached a truly remarkable situation, a grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia and the American electorate.
They're perfect.
Because you've agreed on 90 percent of things, because you have a shared view on so many things, and you politely differ.
How do you do that?
She's 16 years old.
But it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful.
And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.

But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud.
And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.
You might be sleep-deprived, but you'll finish your novel.
We need more than that.
In fact, by definition, these are decisions about something that will happen to us after we die.
It's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it, in some sense?

If this idea is truly sound, then the implications are significant.
Use it to spread great ideas.
The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection.
But we can change all those things I mentioned.
It's not easy to ask.
For instance, just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft.
You have a fantastic ear.
Thank you for listening.
They raise their hands like this.
That's spectacular.

It's hard enough to discriminate between the things that genuinely matter in this world and the minutiae of life, without having emails about supermarket chains and Candy Crush Saga.
(Applause) I have Excel.
Music was once a very physical thing.
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients.
But the real puzzle and irony is that the greatest density of different languages on Earth is found where people are most tightly packed together.
And what worries me, as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse, is that too many organizations are making their decisions, their policies about talent and people, based on assumptions that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.
Now if he had repeated the question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail — and we're all really glad he didn't do that — he would have further discredited himself.

Romantic, yes, but most importantly, it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference.
My American roommate was shocked by me.
Now this is somebody who is brain-dead, legally dead, definitely checked out, but is being kept alive on a respirator, so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation.
We are evolved to second-guess the behavior of others by becoming brilliant, intuitive psychologists.
You want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant, but not very stress reactive, the person who's laid back.
Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us.
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light.
(Applause) I get that all the time in Dubai.
Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked, and private, intimate, nude photos were plastered across the Internet without their permission.
And so I went back and I studied my first two acts, trying to see who I was then, who I really was — not who my parents or other people told me I was, or treated me like I was.
And despite that, it retains a level of realism.
And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation, but in very big difficulties down there.
I hope you'll join me next time when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy.
Once van Meegeren was on trial, he couldn't stop talking.
And maybe I'm just a storyteller.
Like this.
So, social investments in health, education and infrastructure, and electricity is really what is needed in India and China.
Have you ever laughed or smiled when someone said something shitty to you and then spent the rest of the day wondering why you reacted that way?
We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift.
Essentially, it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual, step-by-step increment.
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hire people who believe what you believe.
What just happened?
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor, when there was presumably a competition among many languages?
Maybe not.
And we just did a little intervention.
By that I mean not being lost in thought, not being distracted, not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions, but instead learning how to be in the here and now, how to be mindful, how to be present.
So then, it's a self-perpetuating process.
So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world, where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past.
If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment.
A couple of years ago, I was in New York, and I was pitching a deal, and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture.
In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.
I want you to think about illusion as a metaphor.
That was my mantra.
But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this, because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.
Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this.
And that is seductive.
It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview.
But this is hypothesis-generating.
Sort of an interesting thing.
And you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?"
I found fertility at birth, and I looked at total fertility rate per woman.
Well, maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets.
And here's "The Guide for the Perplexed" by Maimonides.
I know how they do it.
What actually happened was the impulses were reduced.
Fast food.
And I don't understand it, and I never will.
So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.
That's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is.
I use poetry to help me work through what I don't understand, but I show up to each new poem with a backpack full of everywhere else that I've been.
(Applause) (Applause) Thank you.
Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed.
When I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident.
This was me on piano, a genius drummer.
Tesla thought he had the answer.
There is plenty of beautiful things going on.
Ralph Waldo Emerson called him "A man who does not offend by superiority."
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis.
As a result, they can't improve on others' ideas or learn from others' mistakes — benefit from others' wisdom.
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.
A violinist, as we heard, who has done 10,000 hours of violin practice, some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain changes a lot, increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections.
Because when the tacks are out of the box, it's pretty easy isn't it?
The granny cloud sits over there.
So where does this lead?
One third of it, in fact, is genetic.
Yes, it does.
(Laugher)
Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649.
It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech.
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.
Light is good.
Not everybody gets to do that.
It's a mental process, and it's a process of extraction.
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport.
Pull the knot.
We're governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development.
They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.
The latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading.
Thank you very much indeed.
We're human beings.
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London, it is hard to believe that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.
Now, weekend in Paris, weekend in Rome — these are different things.
Also, those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages.
And it's, again, linked to something nice.
And no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute, be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life.
But I decided not to have this treatment.
It's the pivot, it's biology, it's the natural instinct.
Home.
And the question was, will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective, more attractive brothers?
Because here's what's really happening.
You'll be handed rice cakes.
And for dollars, is their 30 million, plus the 20 million dollars from the American manufacturer.
And he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona.
Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school, and we'll take it apart with them.
It was.
One more mind will be unlocked.
Or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round your mind.
After the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime.
Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity.
And all of that happens in the first second.
And this map is also accurate.
And we perfect, most dangerously, our children.
But in this culture of humiliation, there is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming.
But she ate it.
This is it.
Maybe they go later, not right away.
They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket.
We've got a new one this year, but we'll work on that next season.
And I tried, and I made it.
The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on regional level.
And they work.
Now, what's even worse than restriction, is that adults often underestimate kids' abilities.
It meant something that would connect us all together.
And so for us, if you want to know the time, you have to wear something to tell it.
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society.
And she fought, and I know she fought you.
First, population growth.
I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education.
And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were.
But the reality is far from it.
The world population has doubled since I went to school.
We have our first stars.
And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them.
I don't think we are particularly materialistic.
And we will see, you know.
Anyone I point to, call out a three-digit number.
Now, why doesn't this take place?
And that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants' root systems.
The difference was, Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief.
And it made all the sense in the world to me.
Let's see, starting with — let's start with a gentleman first.
Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.
Hopefully these categories, these binaries, these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away.
Maybe we've all been this guy.
And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of.
After traveling so much and meeting so many people, let me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race.
We sat in rows of desks like this, and we did most of our work pretty autonomously.
And when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language.
Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters.
There are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day.
With every click, we make a choice.
In other words, when we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures.
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.
Now, in this paradox between love and desire, what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love — mutuality, reciprocity, protection, worry, responsibility for the other — are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire.
When the contractors have gone bust, as they've been overleveraged like everyone else, the difference is everything goes missing, documentation, passports, and tickets home for these workers.
And many think that these countries are stagnant, but they are not.
Thanks!
If you can cook, time doesn't matter.
And me?
What about this?
That seems right, I'll go on.
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability.
And after all this, everyone paused; they took a step back.
I want you to take a look at this baby.
Vulnerability is not weakness.
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic, replacing virgin plastic, to make their new products.
England and America, England and America.
And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another.
October what?
As a third example, consider consumer products.
As soon they come in, you see it.
Remember when this blue box was all alone, leading the world, living its own life.
But remember, the people in Baghdad, the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan — they don't need to see the video; they see it every day.
And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends.
And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful, what am I talking about?
That's the wonderful richness of life.
OK, great.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
Don't you feel?
And so when people make decisions, and even though the results of the decisions are good, they feel disappointed about them; they blame themselves.
We have this view of ourselves, of others.
There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers.
Or, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet.
The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here, I put fertility rate.
We are highly open to suggestion.
And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology.
Thank you very, very much.
And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural, the rural part of Guizhou goes down there.
There are no real original liars.
Thankfully, we have a new machine, magnetoencephalography, that allows us to do this.
To put it this way, nature knows no other circumstance in which functionally equivalent traits coexist.
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.
And here the science says yes.
So fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us.
Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce.
You basically published something there, ran into trouble with a bank, then the news service there was injuncted from running the story.
You do this.
You may discover, as I did, that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault, a lot of things you used to think about yourself, really had nothing to do with you.
Their groundbreaking technology records the EEG, or the electrical activity of the brain, in real time, allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions: vision, attention, language, audition.
We do so much in the kitchen, I thought this would be interesting.
So what's going on?
But, steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better, it's just that they have stopped getting worse.
It was a slugfest.
We are energy-beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family.
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet.
What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others.
And one fine day, she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary.
And what happened to me was I bought, what was for me, a very expensive pair of shoes.
So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price.
It's perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living.
It used mirrors to create the illusion of tiny people performing on a miniature stage.
Actually, I kind of divide the world into two groups now.
There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up.
So now the universe is chemically more complex.
This is like one of the great things we ever discovered, fire.
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it, but by and large, this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is.
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about?
As history points out, regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control.
That's the work that stands before us.
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark.
But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.
I'm not slagging them off.
Right?
And this is Latin America.
But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?
It wasn't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force.
Yes, there is.
You think you know right and wrong?
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough.
This is what they go through.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.
It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.
And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart.
So it was a series of five painful shocks.
The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills.
Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.
That's not only in the developing world.
One large children's publisher ironically said that they didn't work with children.
You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify.
And then I put the really tough question: "How many of you hand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets?"
Now is my book the next great American novel?
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to.
We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life, and sometimes memory is downright creative.
Granted, it was before social media, but people could still comment online, email stories, and, of course, email cruel jokes.
But the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.
And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke.
Why would you buy one from a computer company?
But as you look at it, I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy.
Very good for the physicians.
So I looked carefully at this guy.
The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything.
And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"
I mean, we have a harm immunization policy.
The average number of children in the world is like in Colombia — it's 2.4 today.
And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data.
So the things that make a photograph look realistic, I think it's the things that we don't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives.
They're going to show they're on your side.
And one of the second commonest is cartoons.
It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it.
I'll show you.
The first principle of aid is respect.
We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives, and we've got to learn to stem the inflow.
And do you know what the answer to this question now is?
Now, there's a similar situation in the classical music world, because there are some people who think that classical music is dying.
The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine, whether or not someone actually make a mistake, and now it's for both public and private people.
So I knew I was dealing with a professional.
In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere.
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.
The thread that links them all: our addiction to carbon based fuels, like dirty coal and foreign oil.
You get books out of the machines, children's books.
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops.
It's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives.
If your job is to dance, do your dance.
And it is all out of carbon fiber.
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff — the therapists, the poets — are on their own and they have no power, they have no might.
Nowadays, everything is very much up for grabs.
They can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet again.
That's the American experience.
It's perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm, to be free of career anxiety.
It's about enjoying mundane sounds.
There's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren, but I want to turn now to Goering, who's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg.
There's no question that some choice is better than none, but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice.
Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course.
I want to make a hard-headed, evidence-based, dare I say lawyerly case, for rethinking how we run our businesses.
I look at hormones.
First, there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe, given its state over all of space at one time.
You can't.
It may be the ultimate time-lapse image: the anatomy of Earth brought to life.
And that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it, we're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion.
These aren't the last words I'll share.
One, two, three.
The second shock hurts just as much, and the third and the fourth and the fifth.
Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you.
This is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn.
It's just really about combining different realities.
What about resources?
India's the big bubble in the middle.
Why does this matter?
The first few systems that we created, they kind of worked.
Are you ready?
That is true.
If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name.
You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome.
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back?
Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago — he wondered how, thinking these hallucinations, how, as he put it, the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain.
Instead of making better choices, we become overwhelmed by choice, sometimes even afraid of it.
Because, of course, this is a photograph that you can't take with your camera.
Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives.
I knew these were all words they use, right?
And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this.
And a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well.
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it.
But the people who were in unhappy relationships, on the days when they reported more physical pain, it was magnified by more emotional pain.
The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world — nothing more, nothing less.
You can locate your voice, however.
Why him?
But it is not impossible.
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better.
No, right?
It leads, in the worst cases — in the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim — it leads to increased rates of suicide.
And I need you to know that this is going to kill your children early.
To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it.
Vodka, New Year's Eve — new partner for the spring.
Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional.
Think about smoking.
At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories — thousands of pieces of data in six years.
He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel.
Yes, it's safe here.
I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions.
Persist!
I'm going to play it all the way through and you're going to follow.
These contingent motivators — if you do this, then you get that — work in some circumstances.
Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.
And if you think it's simply because we are not interested, you would be wrong.
Now, adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids, from every "Don't do that, don't do this" in the school handbook, to restrictions on school Internet use.
We numb vulnerability — when we're waiting for the call.
Now I want to pause for a moment, 380,000 years after the origins of the universe, because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage.
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
The smartest people in your community you don't even know, because they don't come to your public meetings.
And you have to satisfy us first that your English is good enough.
I see, I see one way in the back.
She had not only read the book, but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel.
The doctors said that I wouldn't walk, but I am here in front of you.
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome, you don't go to those higher levels.
He wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne, and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him.
Because every time we've done this, in every classroom we've done, over and over again, if you go five days into it, there's a group of kids who've raced ahead and a group who are a little bit slower.
How about quality?
(Laughter) The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all.
Professor, we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today.
And it has — the steady state is, more or less, one percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected.
There's a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything, and the existence of low self-esteem.
What about global politics?
I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process.
There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction in my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems.
And it was the kind of caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream.
James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship.
So they are well-motivated.
We learn these really bad lessons really well.
The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable, because we are in need of guidance, morality and consolation — and religions know that.
One is that human talent is tremendously diverse.
So you can open this one.
How do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion?
My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people, including the majority of Muslims, get to see.
C'mon, fire!
So I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time — my Facebook page.
77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822.
But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnine system, and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park, just because we can.
British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate.
(Laughter) So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically, and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment.
The outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on.
So stay with me, because it does circle around and back.
I have a slight office supply addiction, but that's another talk.
He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees, and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.
To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility.
You change your behavior, and you change your mind.
Primates, on the other hand, we use our mouths more.
It's not fair that you can change your height, as you want it.
You want button fly or zipper fly?
Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well, because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak.
When I was in Huntington, trying to get a few things to work when they weren't, I thought "If I had a magic wand, what would I do?"
Of course, I can't be sure.
So, it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean.
It doesn't really matter.
At that time, a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India.
Under extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space.
And the official dogma runs like this: if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens, the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom.
And unlike all of the other animals, we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.
And then —
And this is really important in the MBA classroom, because participation counts for half the grade.
And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water, no air conditioning, and their passports taken away.
I see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired.
And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family.
Maps matter.
So I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24-7.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
It's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein.
Come on.
And beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do.
So the second question really was, you know, so we know that our minds change our bodies, but is it also true that our bodies change our minds?
It's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you're actually teaching.
If I'm right, this means that high office in the greatest country in the world is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it — the intelligentsia — unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs.
So there they are.
But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe?
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.
I kept up the charade for eight years.
We seem to appreciate this fact, but only in retrospect.
And so I want to walk you in to shame.
I said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked.
These are tiny differences, but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity.
There's no unemployment in squatter cities.
Or, you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others.
This is not a philosophy.
The winning algorithms were able to match the grades given by human teachers.
And this is because in small groups there are fewer ideas, there are fewer innovations.
It's real.
My estimation is that probably 45 of you are absolutely passionate about classical music.
We bond together based on anything that we can — music preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on.
Nine.
We've got to clear the arteries of our lives.
And on the very first day, our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit.
Well if that's not you, that's not the end of the world, because you can train.
The solution, if it exists at all, is surprising and not obvious.
One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day.
And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist.
For my senior collection at fashion design school, I decided to try and 3D print an entire fashion collection from my home.
But that's not all.
Now you pursue this guy, gesticulating.
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space.
I'd like to tell you about one such child, whose story was also covered by ABC News.
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.
(Laughter) Okay.
People aren't simply projecting identity, they're creating it.
And the public is there, and the Internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively.
It heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour.
I love that.
The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals.
I'm depressed.
And we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now.
We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones.
Let's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own.
So what happened?
Theodoor van De Velde was something of a semen connoisseur.
And we reinforce the storyline, right?
But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures, we are at risk.
And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there.
They were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin.
I took this and I gave it to 100 MIT students.

Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric?
It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore.
But we want stuff that we're going to love for years, not just stuff.
And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it, instead of in brain research, towards diagnosing brain disorders in children.
But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health.
Pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don't make real mistakes in planes.
So what happened when the professor left the room?
The time is now.
Me and the rest of the team were like, "They're never going to want to do this."
We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways.
If I search for something, and you search for something, even right now at the very same time, we may get very different search results.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.
The other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants, where everything is not standardized, they're customized to local circumstances.
And it's 12 units used in the entire world, and the richest one billion, they use six of them.
Back at the time, a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing.
One summer break, I came here to New York for an internship at a fashion house in Chinatown.
And if you simply show people these pictures, they'll say these are fairly attractive people.
The technologies do not exist to do that.

I think in some ways, the reason I started the project, even though I didn't know it at the time, was because I was struggling with my own secrets.
You hear the traffic.
Tesla's insight was profound.
Guess what fixed that.
Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation, for two minutes, try doing this, in the elevator, in a bathroom stall, at your desk behind closed doors.

What do you need to hear?
In 1998, we had no way of knowing where this brave new technology called the Internet would take us.
You can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks.
So this is what's driving the effect, or mediating the effect.
We've seen that to be true with racism, homophobia, and plenty of other biases, today and in the past.
And I tested them.
We can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those of foreign languages.

What struck me was this: She had felt sorry for me even before she saw me.
And instead of a balanced information diet, you can end up surrounded by information junk food.
As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead, or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy, they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership, which is that it comes from within.
And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way.
What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it?
The poem was very indignant, and mainly exaggerated, but the only spoken-word poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant, so I thought that's what was expected of me.

I bought a fast car.
And this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences.
I knew that these printers were much cheaper and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship.
And DNA, of course, is the beautiful molecule that contains that information.
By the way, this is what they get buried in.
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters.
You know, this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term not because we want 14 children, for which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it, and not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty.

When the online world learned of this incident, the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.
Let's do it backwards.
What will happen is economic growth.
I'm a scientist, so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric, but by marinating you in a little bit of data.
(Music)
What year was it, first of all?
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
Now as I was there, I guess, like a lot of people, I assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind.
This is a library in Auckland.
Really?
What do they do?
There's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt.
They get no great pleasure from what they do.

What's alarming here is that our business operating system — think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses, how we motivate people, how we apply our human resources— it's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators, around carrots and sticks.
What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do; people buy why you do it.

With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck, we've looked to see what sort of factors, what sort of history, matters for the objects that people like.
And the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did.

You see it on their faces and their bodies, and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny, and they go like this when they raise their hand.
The first shock hurts like hell.
One thing is distant relationships among human languages.
They become lovely monsters.
And so it seems that we use our language, not just to cooperate, but to draw rings around our cooperative groups and to establish identities, and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills from eavesdropping from outside.
And humans do the same thing.
Seriously — doomed, doomed!
It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time.

When I was a kid, I wanted to be a man.
That was awesome.
It was totally life-changing.
And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.
I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection.
The problem is — and I learned this from the research — that you cannot selectively numb emotion.
And that makes failure seem much more crushing.
I teach wonderfully intelligent students, and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to.
They fly, not with rotating components, so they fly only by flapping their wings.
I bring you into a room.

So one reason why you might like something is its utility.
And it's focus.
If you don't believe me, you can get the slide later and do some arts and crafts and see that they're identical.
